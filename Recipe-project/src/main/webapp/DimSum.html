 <ul>
 <li><h2>Ingredients:</h2></li>
 <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
 <li>225g large shrimp, peeled, deveined and minced</li><br>
 <li>3 tbsp Chinese chives (or spring onions), finely chopped</li><br>
 <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li><br>
 <li>1 tbsp Shaohsing rice wine</li><br>
 <li>Sea salt</li><br>
 <li>Freshly ground white pepper</li><br>
 <li>2 tbsp peanut oil</li><br>
 
 </ul>
 <li><h2>Method:</h2></li>
 <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
 <li>Mix all the filling ingredients into a bowl and with clean hands squeeze the filling through your fingers so that all the flavors are combined well. Wash your hands and dry well.</li><br>

<li>Sprinkle a sheet tray or a plate with some cornflour. Then place a dumpling wrapper in the palm of your hand. Place a heaped teaspoon of the filling in the middle of the dumpling skin. Then dip your finger into a water bowl and brush around the rim.</li><br>

<li>Fold in half so you have a half moon shape pressing down on the edges to make sure the dumpling wrapper sticks together well. Pleat the edges of the dumpling four times pinching well to secure. Place the pot stickers on the cornflour dusted sheet tray until ready to cook. (Tip: you could make ahead to this point and freeze in an air-tight container, then cook from frozen when desired.)</li><br>

<li>In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the dipping sauce and set aside.</li><br>
